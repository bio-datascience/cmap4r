# Installation

CMAP hosts data on a Microsoft SQL Server. An R user will need the following
package to connect to the database: a) “DBI”, for database interface; b) “odbc”
for connecting to the database using **DBI** interface.

**Mac OS** First install the unixODBC library and database drivers. We suggest
using SQL Server ODBC drivers (Free TDS). Using Homebrew, run the following
commands to install the suggested module.


+ brew install unixodbc
+ brew install freetds


**Linux OS** First, install [Anaconda
distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#linux), and then run the
following commands to install suggested module.

+ conda install -c anaconda unixodbc
+ conda install -c anaconda freetds


Please follow the [link](https://db.rstudio.com/best-practices/drivers/) to see
other drivers available for installation.

**Windows OS** Not written yet.
