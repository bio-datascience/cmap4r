**Q**: On a linux machine, my authentication becomes outdated after hibernation

**A**: Under Ubuntu, the keyring is automatically locked by default while hibernating. When starting Ubuntu after hibernation, it prompts you for the keyring password.

To disable this lock:

Go in Applications > System Tools > Configuration Editor
Uncheck /apps/gnome-power-manager/lock/gnome_keyring_hibernate
Note: you can also launch the config editor with the gconf-editor command.
