**Q:** How does this differ from the Python package?

**A:** This is better. Use this.


**Q:** My ODBC and FreeTDS setup doesn't work.

**A:** If you set up the DSN files (the odbc.ini file and odbcinst.ini file,
both located in /etc/odbc.ini or /opt/local/etc/odbc.ini) as directed, it should
initiate a connection correctly. One possibility is that there are local DSN
files in your home directory (~/.odbc.inst and ~/.odbcinst.ini). Your database
connection will check for these files first. If these exist, either delete them
or modify these as instructed, and use these as your primary DSN files.

A bit more about ODBC and ODBCINST:
1. Basically, we need to modify the ~ODBCINST.INI~ and ~ODBC.INI~ files to
   contain information about the CMAP database, in order to connect to it.
2. The system file ~odbcinst.ini~ contains information about ODBC drivers
   available to all users, and
3. The ~odbc.ini~ file contains information about DSN's available to all users.
4. In short, ~odbcinst.ini~ defines driver options, while ~odbc.ini~ defines
connection options. ~ODBCINST.INI~ should contain a pointer:

```{}
[FreeTDS]
Description=FreeTDS Driver for MSSQL (unix users)
Driver=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so
Setup=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/odbc/libtdsodbc.so
UsageCount=1
```

Your ODBCINST.INI should contain the driver to use i.e. ~Driver = FreeTDS~, and
optionally the credentials to connecting to the server (the server address, the
UID and PWD, and Port). You can also specify these at run time, in your R
script.
