# Getting started

## Obtaining and saving API Key

CMAP hosts data on a Microsoft SQL Server. To retrieve data from the database,
`cmap4r` requires an API key. For this, the user needs to register on the
[SimonsCMAP](https://simonscmap.com/register) website and navigate to the
"APIKeys" tab on the webpage to obtain an API key. The package allows theÂ user
to save the key as a **keyring variable** which will be used for data retrieval
whenever required.

After installing `cmap4r` (using
`devtools::install_github("simonscmap/cmap4r/cmap4r")`), use the
`set_authorization()` function to set/reset the API Key. You will be prompted to
enter the key on the command line or in a pop-up prompt.

## Catalog of data

You can obtain the latest version of the data catalog for the CMAP data
(https://cmap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/catalog/catalog.html) to R using
`get_catalog()`, partially reproduced here.

```{r example-catalog, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
get_catalog() %>%
  select(Variable, Table_Name, Unit, Sensor, Unit) %>%
  head(20) %>%
  kable()
```
